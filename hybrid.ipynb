    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a hybrid retrieval system that integrates ***dense retrieval*** using **FAISS** and ***sparse retrieval*** using **BM25**. The system allows us to perform efficient document search by leveraging embeddings from a PDF document. The retrieval results can be compared from both methods, showcasing the benefits of hybrid retrieval in enhancing search relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **Dense Retrieval with FAISS**: Utilizes embeddings generated by the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for efficient vector similarity searches.\n",
    "- **Sparse Retrieval with BM25**: Implements the BM25 algorithm for traditional keyword-based searches.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Retrieval Approach**: Combines results from both methods to provide more relevant search outcomes.\n",
    "- **PDF Support**: Loads content directly from a PDF document for searching.\n",

       "'Kubernetes For Everyone\\nKubernetes introduction and features\\nHow Kubernetes works?\\nIn Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle\\nmultiple pods.\\nPods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing\\nyour applications using pods.\\nOnce your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you\\nwant to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control.\\nIt takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes\\nstarts new pods on a functioning worker node.\\nThis makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.\\nIt makes it easy to build and add more features and improving the application to attain higher\\ncustomer satisfaction.\\nFinally, no matter what technology you\\'re invested in, Kubernetes can help you.\\nImage credits: Source: Knoldus Inc What is the Master node and Worker node in #Kubernetes?\\nExplained below,\\n#Containerization is the trend that is taking over the world, allowing firms to run any kind of different\\napplications in a variety of different environments. To keep track of all these containers, to schedule,\\nto manage, and to orchestrate them, we all require an orchestration tool. Kubernetes does it\\nexponentially well.\\nKubernetes is a master-slave type of architecture. It operated with Master node and worker node\\nprinciples.\\nWhat exactly they do?\\nMaster Node:\\n>The main machine that controls the nodes\\n> Main entry point for all administrative tasks\\n> It handles the orchestration of the worker nodes\\nWorker Node:\\n> It is a worker machine in Kubernetes (used to be known as a minion)\\n> This machine performs the requested tasks. The Master Node controls each Node\\n> Runs containers inside pods\\n> This is where the Docker engine runs and takes care of downloading images and starting\\ncontainers\\nKnow in-depth concepts here in the original article: https://blog.risingstack.com/what-is-kubernetes-\\nhow-to-get-started/ #Containers are the de-facto deployment format of today.\\nBut where does #Kubernetes comes in the play?\\nWhile tools such as #Docker provide the actual containers, we also need tools to take care of things\\nsuch as replication, failovers, orchestration, and that is where Kubernetes comes into play.\\nThe Kubernetes API is a great tool for automating a deployment pipeline. Deployments are not only\\nmore reliable, but also much faster, because we’re no longer dealing with VMs.\\nWhen working with Kubernetes, you have to become accustomed with concepts and namings like\\npods, services, and replication controllers. If you\\'re not already familiar yet, no worries, there are\\nsome excellent resources available to learn Kubernetes and get up to speed.\\nSome key features of Kubernetes that make it unique,\\n> Service Discovery\\n> Health Check Capability\\n> Simplified Monitoring\\n> Self-healing\\n> Secret and configuration management\\n> Horizontal scaling\\n> Storage Management\\n> Networking\\n> Services > ConfigMap and Secret\\n> Logging\\n> Rolling update or rollback\\n> Load balancing\\nWhat feature do you like the most in Kubernetes?\\nBTW, take a look at these tips, tricks, and lessons for taking containerized apps to k8s:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/eZtxx-Z\\nImage credits: TheNewStack\\n#Kubernetes features that we all like:)\\n> Automatic binpacking: This is where Kubernetes helps in automatically placing containers based\\non their resource requirements, limits, and other constraints, without compromising on availability.\\n> Service discovery and load balancing: In simple words, service discovery is the process of figuring\\nout how to connect to a service.\\n>Self-healing: Restarts the containers that fail, replaces, and reschedules containers when nodes die.\\n> Automated rollouts and rollbacks: With this feature, Kubernetes does progressively roll out\\nchanges, and it ensures it doesn’t kill all your instances at the same time. > Secrets and configuration management: Kubernetes has a built-in mechanism of storing\\nconfiguration values that you would prefer to keep private. Sensitive information such as user name,\\npasswords with encryption, and other credentials can be kept confidentially.\\n> Storage orchestration: Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local\\nstorage, a public cloud provider such as GCP or AWS, or a network storage system such as NFS,\\niSCSI, Gluster, Ceph, Cinder, or Flocker.\\nSee more in the original article: https://lnkd.in/e8MzdeV\\n#Kubernetes helps in easy automation of container lifecycle management.\\nHowever, the concept of Kubernetes is quite complex.\\nHere are the top practices of Kubernetes:)\\n> Dis-allow root users\\n> Dis-allow privileged containers > Use pod resource limits and requests\\n> Dis-allow new capabilities addition\\n> Dis-allow any changes to the parameters of the kernel\\n> Dis-allow using bin mounts\\n> Use read-only root filesystem\\n> Dis-allow dock socket bind mount access\\n> Dis-allow usage of host ports and networks\\n> Keep smaller base image\\nWhat else? Know more: https://lnkd.in/ejetevG\\n \\n \\n#Kubernetes Core Features.\\n1. Container runtime: Kubernetes uses Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to transparently manage\\nyour containers without necessarily having to know (or deal with) the runtime used.\\n2. The Network Plugin: As we discussed earlier, a container orchestration system is responsible\\n(among other things) for managing the network through which containers and services\\ncommunicate.\\n3. The Volume Plugin: A volume broadly refers to the storage that will be availed for the pod. 4. Image Registry: Kubernetes must contact an image registry (whether public or private) to be able\\nto pull images and spin out container.\\n5. Cloud Provider: Kubernetes can be deployed on almost any platform you may think of.\\n6. Identity Provider: You can use your own identity provider system to authenticate your users to the\\ncluster as long as it uses OpenID connect. Read this amazing article: https://lnkd.in/eySj5aG\\nKubernetes setup:\\nHow much time can you devote to setting up the #Kubernetes ?\\ue012\\ue013\\ue014\\ue015\\ue016\\ue017\\ue000\\ue000 \\ue00d\\ue00e\\ue00f\\ue010\\ue011\\nThat\\'s the question to ask yourself.\\nBecause installing and setting up Kubernetes can be daunting. Yes!\\nKubernetes itself (meaning the plain, open-source version) does not have a built-in installer, nor does\\nit offer much in the way of one-size-fits-all default configurations. You’ll likelyneed to tweak (or write\\nfrom scratch) a lot of configuration files before you get your cluster up and running smoothly.\\nThus, the process of installing and configuring Kubernetes can be a very daunting one that\\nconsumes many days of work.\\nSome Kubernetes distributions offer interactive installer scripts that help automate much of the\\nsetup process. If you use one of these, setup and installation is easier to accomplish in a day or two.\\nBut it’s still by no means a turnkey process. A third option is to run Kubernetes as a managed service in the cloud using a solution like Google\\nKubernetes Engine, but the downside is, you have less choice and control in determining how to\\nconfigure your Kubernetes environment.\\nKnow more on the facts to consider before selecting Kubernetes: bit.ly/KubernetesSetup\\n \\n#Kubernetes autoscaling. How does it work?\\nScaling is an essential operational practice that used to be done manually for a long time concerning\\napplications, with the introduction of tools like Kubernetes, the things have changed dramatically in\\nthe software industry.\\nIn the context of the Kubernetes cluster, there are typically two things you would like to scale as a\\nuser, Pods, and Nodes.\\nThere are three types of scaling:\\n> HorizontalPodAutoscaler\\n> VerticalPodAutoscaler, and\\n> Cluster Autoscaler.\\nWith these techniques, Kubernetes can take intelligent scaling decisions automatically.\\nHorizontalPodAutoscaler refers to increasing the number of Pods serving the application, in\\nresponse to the present computational needs.\\nVerticalPodAutoscaler involves expanding the resources of the Pods.\\nCluster Autoscaler (CA) scales your node clusters based on the number of pending pods. It checks\\nto see whether there are any pending pods and increases the size of the cluster so that these pods\\ncan be created.\\nMastering autoscaling needs some patience and persistent efforts to see which technique suits your\\napp\\'s needs by doing trial and error.\\nContinuous learning and experimentation is the key:) More or less #Kubernetes clusters.\\nHow to decide?\\nKubernetes is devised as a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a\\nsingle unit for more power and efficiency.\\nThe cluster forms the heart of Kubernetes: It can schedule and run containers across a group of\\nmachines, be they physical or virtual, on-premises or in the cloud. A Kubernetes cluster is formed out of 2 types of resources:\\n> Master is coordinating the cluster\\n> Nodes are where we run applications\\nKubernetes is still a bit of sophisticated technology and has a steep learning curve, even after a\\ncouple of years working with it, you’ll stillwonder if you got it all under control.\\nBut when your company asks you to decide on using and implementing Kubernetes, one question\\nyou will have is, deciding on the Kubernetes clusters.\\nMy friend Sander has written an amazing article on this, take a look - https://lnkd.in/eSC5vpa\\nKubernetes security:\\nKeep your clusters updated with the latest #Kubernetes security patches.\\nSee how and why...\\nJust like any application, Kubernetes is continuously updating new features and security updates.\\nHence, it is imperative that the underlying nodes and Kubernetes clusters need to be in parallel and\\nup to date as well.\\nThe standard “zonal” KubernetesEngine clusters will have only one master node backing them, but\\nyou can create “regional” clusters that provide multi-zone feature, highly available masters. One\\ncrucial thing to remember here is, while creating a cluster, be sure to select the “regional”option. By using Kubernetes Engine, you can keep your Kubernetes cluster up to date with just a few clicks.\\nIt is highly recommended to use Kubernetes Engine regional clusters for the high-availability masters\\nand automatic node upgrades to have a hassle-free upgrade experience.\\n(Source: cloud.google.com )\\nSee my in-depth article on Kubernetes security best practices: https://lnkd.in/eZq9mGs\\nIn 2018, a severe vulnerability in #Kubernetes (CVE-2018–1002105) was\\ndisclosed...\\nThis vulnerability allowed an unauthorized and unauthenticated user to gain full admin privileges on\\na cluster and perform privilege escalation. In one more incident, a security firm RedLock said that hackers accessed one of Tesla’s Amazon\\ncloud accounts, and they used it to run cryptocurrency-mining malware. The initial point of entry for\\nthe Tesla cloud breach was an unsecured administrative console for Kubernetes.\\nSo many scary stories!\\nDo you know how important is security in Kubernetes?\\nKnow here in my in-depth article - https://lnkd.in/ecviJ6c\\n\\'Role-Based Access Control\\' is one of the security best practices in\\n#Kubernetes .\\nKnow more about it below... RBAC allows Kubernetes architects to specify which types of actions are permitted for a user and\\nwhat kind of tasks they are going to perform depending on their role in the organization This is\\nhow you create roles based on the different kinds of access your users and applications need to\\nvarious resources, and later assign only the required and minimum permissions for appropriate\\naccess to the roles. Minimum or restricting access to only specified and well-identified users who\\nmust perform defined actions on a resource is critical in securing your cluster and is one of the\\nsecurity best practices. To tighten the security and ease handling a large number of accounts,\\nRBAC makes use of an intermediate item called binding. Via role binding mechanism, you can\\ncreate “roles,” which will have a set of capabilities, then assign eachuser one or more roles. For\\nexample, some users might just have permission to list pods, and some other users may have\\npermission to get, list, watch, create, update, patch, delete pods. Writing an article on this and will\\nbe out soon.\\n[No doubt, It is highly challenging to embrace #CloudNative and#DevOps in\\nregulated industries.\\nAs#microservices and container-based infrastructure are enriching how the software is built these\\ndays, new challenges with security and compliance appear for regulated firms. Regulated industries imply several challenges\\n> Strong restrictions on secured networks\\n> Fine-grained audit trails\\n> Strong ACLs models\\n> Full lifecycle governance\\n> Integration with 3rd parties\\nHere is an example where Artem Semenov from Align Technology is showing us the basic\\nrequirements for making #K8S compliant with sensitive data handling regulations and possible\\ntechnical solutions - https://lnkd.in/g2G-rFX\\nKubernetes case studies:\\nDelivering Pizza with #Kubernetes ?\\nDomino’s #CloudNative story is mind-blowing.

Read…\\nA few years ago at Box, it was taking up to six months to build a new\\n#microservice .\\nFast forward to today, it takes only a couple of days.\\nHow did they manage to speed up? Two key factors made it possible,\\n1. Kubernetes technology\\n2. DevOps practices\\nFounded in 2005, Box was a monolithic PHP application and had grown over time to millions of lines\\nof code. The monolithic nature of their application led to them basically building very tightly coupled\\ndesigns, and this tight coupling was coming in their way. It was resulting in them not being able to\\ninnovate as quickly as they wanted to. Bugs in one part of their application would require them to roll back the entire application. So many\\nengineers working on the same code base with millions of lines of code, bugs were not that\\nuncommon. It was increasingly hard to ship features or even bug fixes on time. So they looked out\\nfor a solution and decided to go with the microservices approach. But then they started to face\\nanother set of problems....That\\'s where Kubernetes came in:)\\nSee the full video talk by Kunal Parmar, Senior Engineering Manager at Box: https://lnkd.in/etnJTbE\\nI hope you all are #GoT fans here...\\nLet me tell you the #Kubernetes story at HBO!\\nThe engineers started panicking as they knew the unpredictable traffic for the most anticipated\\nGame of Thrones season seven premiere is going to be HUGE.\\nOne of the challenges they found out was the under-utilization of the deployed resources.\\nNode.js code tends only to use a single CPU core.\\nAWS EC2 instances that had excellent networking capabilities tended to be based on dual-core\\nCPUs.\\nAs such, HBO was only using 50 percent of the deployed CPU capacity across its deployment. The\\nability to spin up new instances on EC2 wasn\\'t quite as fast as what HBO needed.\\nHBO also found that in times of peak demand for Game of Thrones, it was also running out of\\navailable IP addresses to help deliver the content to viewers. \"We went from not running a single service inside of a container to hosting all of Games of Thrones\\nseason 7 with Kubernetes,\" Illya Chekrygin, Senior Staff Engineer at HBO told the KubeCon audience.\\nAt last, the HBO chose Kubernetes among other alternatives, basically because of its vibrant and\\nactive community.\\nCredits: KubeCon 2017, eWEEK\\nItaly\\'s biggest traditional bank is embracing #Kubernetes ?\\nA conventional bank running its real business on such a young technology?\\nNo way, are you kidding me?\\nNope, I am not kidding. Italy\\'s banking group, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made this transition.\\nThese are banks who still run their ATM networks on 30-year-old mainframe technology, and\\nembracing the hottest trend & tech is nearly unbelievable. Even though ING, the banking and\\nfinancial corporation, changed the way the banks were seen by upgrading itself with Kubernetes and\\n#DevOps practices very early in the game, there was still a stigma with adopting Kubernetes in the\\nhighly regulated and controlled environments like Healthcare, Banks, etc.\\nThe bank\\'s engineering team came up with an initiative strategy in 2018 to throw away the old way\\nof thinking and started embracing the technologies like microservices, container architecture, and\\nmigrate from monolithic to multi-tier applications. It was transforming itself into a software\\ncompany, unbelievable. Today the bank runs more than 3,000 applications. Of those, more than 120 are now running in\\nproduction using the new microservices architecture, including two of the 10 most business-critical\\nfor the bank.\\nRead the full case here: https://lnkd.in/e_c5fbg\\nHow did \\'Pokemon Go\\' able to scale so efficiently?\\nThe answer is #Kubernetes . Read the story...\\n500+ million downloads and 20+ million daily active users. That\\'s HUGE.\\nPokemon Go engineers never thought their user base would increase exponentially surpassing the\\nexpectations within a short time. Even the servers couldn\\'t handle this much traffic.\\nThe Challenge:\\nThe horizontal scaling on one side but Pokemon Go also faced a severe challenge when it came to\\nvertical scaling because of the real-time activity by millions of users worldwide. Niantic was not\\nprepared for this.\\nThe Solution:\\nThe magic of containers. The application logic for the game ran on Google Container Engine (GKE)\\npowered by the open-source Kubernetes project. Niantic chose GKE for its ability to orchestrate their container cluster at planetary-scale, freeing its\\nteam to focus on deploying live changes for their players. In this way, Niantic used Google Cloud to\\nturn Pokémon GO into a service for millions of players, continuously adapting and improving. This\\ngot them more time to concentrate on building the game\\'s application logic and new features rather\\nthan worrying about the scaling part.\\n“Going Viral” is not always easy to predict but you can always have Kubernetes in your tech stack.\\nCI/CD with Kubernetes:\\nHow can you quickly achieve CI/CD automation with #Kubernetes and roll it out across your\\norganization?\\nStep 1: Develop your microservice using dependencies from registries that are proxied in Artifactory.\\nThe resulting App package can be a .war or .jar file.\\nStep 2: Create a Docker Framework using Tomcat and Java-8 on Ubuntu as a base image. Push this\\nimage to a Docker registry in Artifactory, where it is also scanned by Xray to assure security and\\nlicense compliance.\\nStep 3: Create the Docker image for the microservice by adding the .war/.jar file to the Docker\\nFramework, and push the image to a Docker registry in Artifactory, where it is scanned by Xray.\\nStep 4: Create a Helm chart for the microservice, and push it to a Helm repository in Artifactory. Step 5: Deploy the microservice from the secure Docker registry to the Kubernetes cluster using the\\nHelm Chart.\\nSee the in-depth article: https://lnkd.in/e4Vkc3m\\nSurvey and findings:\\n#Kubernetes usage in production is skyrocketing\\ue018 \\ue019\\ue01a\\ue01b\\ue01c\\ue01d\\ue01e\\ue01f \\nWhat else?\\nHere are 15 interesting takeaways from the #CNCF annual survey.

      "\u001b[31mKubernetes For Everyone Kubernetes introduction and features How Kubernetes works? In Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle multiple pods. Pods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing your applications using pods. Once your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you want to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control. It takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes starts new pods on a functioning worker node. This makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.\u001b[0m\n",

The critical goal for News UK was to be better able to scale up its environment around breaking news events & unpredictable reader volumes. They thought if VMs can help them, but soon they realized that VMs take long to spin up and when there is a spike of traffic, it is not fast enough to bring new capacity into the AutoScalingGroup (that's what Marcin Cuber, a former cloud DevOps engineer at News UK has to say) They adopted Docker and Kubernetes. Docker containers running in Kubernetes are smaller and lightweight, and they can easily help to scale up or scale down as required. Cuber also had some advice for any organization looking to adopt Docker and Kubernetes. > make your Docker images as small as possible and to focus on running stateless applications with Kubernetes > run health checks for your applications and to use YAML to deploy anything News UK also wanted to cut cloud costs, so they paired EKS clusters with AWS spot instances, and they also used AWS Lambda to make this work efficiently.

After evaluating many offerings from different firms, they selected Kubernetes as they thought it aligned exactly with what they were trying to solve. One of the key aims at Bloomberg was to make better use of existing hardware investments using different features of Kubernetes. As a result, they were able to very efficiently use the hardware to the point where they could get close to 90 to 95 percent utilization rates (as per Andrey Rybka, head of the compute infrastructure team at Bloomberg) Nothing great comes easy; Kubernetes makes many things simpler only if you know how to use it.

       "['Kubernetes For Everyone Kubernetes introduction and features How Kubernetes works? In Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle multiple pods. Pods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing your applications using pods. Once your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you want to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control. It takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes starts new pods on a functioning worker node. This makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.',\n",

       "'Kubernetes For Everyone Kubernetes introduction and features How Kubernetes works? In Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle multiple pods. Pods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing your applications using pods. Once your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you want to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control. It takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes starts new pods on a functioning worker node. This makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.'"

In Kubernetes, there is a master node and multiple worker nodes, each worker node can handle multiple pods. Pods are just a bunch of containers clustered together as a working unit. You can start designing your applications using pods. Once your pods are ready, you can specify pod definitions to the master node, and how many you want to deploy. From this point, Kubernetes is in control. It takes the pods and deploys them to the worker nods. If a worker node goes down, Kubernetes starts new pods on a functioning worker node. This makes the process of managing the containers easy and simple.',\n",

Read… A few years ago at Box, it was taking up to six months to build a new #microservice . Fast forward to today, it takes only a couple of days. How did they manage to speed up? Two key factors made it possible,\",\n",
       " '1. Kubernetes technology 2. DevOps practices Founded in 2005, Box was a monolithic PHP application and had grown over time to millions of lines of code. The monolithic nature of their application led to them basically building very tightly coupled designs, and this tight coupling was coming in their way. It was resulting in them not being able to innovate as quickly as they wanted to. Bugs in one part of their application would require them to roll back the entire application.',\n",
       " \"So many engineers working on the same code base with millions of lines of code, bugs were not that uncommon. It was increasingly hard to ship features or even bug fixes on time. So they looked out for a solution and decided to go with the microservices approach. But then they started to face another set of problems. . . .That's where Kubernetes came in:) See the full video talk by Kunal Parmar, Senior Engineering Manager at Box: https://lnkd.in/etnJTbE\",\n",
       " 'I hope you all are #GoT fans here. . . Let me tell you the #Kubernetes story at HBO! The engineers started panicking as they knew the unpredictable traffic for the most anticipated Game of Thrones season seven premiere is going to be HUGE. One of the challenges they found out was the under-utilization of the deployed resources. Node.js code tends only to use a single CPU core. AWS EC2 instances that had excellent networking capabilities tended to be based on dual-core CPUs. As such, HBO was only using 50 percent of the deployed CPU capacity across its deployment.',\n",
       " 'The ability to spin up new instances on EC2 wasn\\'t quite as fast as what HBO needed. HBO also found that in times of peak demand for Game of Thrones, it was also running out of available IP addresses to help deliver the content to viewers. \"We went from not running a single service inside of a container to hosting all of Games of Thrones season 7 with Kubernetes,\" Illya Chekrygin, Senior Staff Engineer at HBO told the KubeCon audience. At last, the HBO chose Kubernetes among other alternatives, basically because of its vibrant and',\n",

No way, are you kidding me? Nope, I am not kidding. Italy's banking group, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made this transition. These are banks who still run their ATM networks on 30-year-old mainframe technology, and embracing the hottest trend & tech is nearly unbelievable. Even though ING, the banking and financial corporation, changed the way the banks were seen by upgrading itself with Kubernetes and #DevOps practices very early in the game, there was still a stigma with adopting Kubernetes in the highly regulated and controlled environments like Healthcare, Banks, etc. The bank's engineering team came up with an initiative strategy in 2018 to throw away the old way of thinking and started embracing the technologies like microservices, container architecture, and migrate from monolithic to multi-tier applications. It was transforming itself into a software company, unbelievable. Today the bank runs more than 3,000 applications. Of those, more than 120 are now running in production using the new microservices architecture, including two of the 10 most business-critical for the bank.\",\n",

Read the story. . . 500+ million downloads and 20+ million daily active users. That's HUGE. Pokemon Go engineers never thought their user base would increase exponentially surpassing the expectations within a short time. Even the servers couldn't handle this much traffic. The Challenge: The horizontal scaling on one side but Pokemon Go also faced a severe challenge when it came to vertical scaling because of the real-time activity by millions of users worldwide.\",\n",
       " \"Niantic was not prepared for this. The Solution: The magic of containers. The application logic for the game ran on Google Container Engine (GKE) powered by the open-source Kubernetes project. Niantic chose GKE for its ability to orchestrate their container cluster at planetary-scale, freeing its team to focus on deploying live changes for their players. In this way, Niantic used Google Cloud to turn Pokémon GO into a service for millions of players, continuously adapting and improving. This got them more time to concentrate on building the game's application logic and new features rather than worrying about the scaling part. “Going Viral” is not always easy to predict but you can always have Kubernetes in your tech stack.\",\n",
